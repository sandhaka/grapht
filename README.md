# Grapht

This project implements a high-performance **graph processing system**, designed for efficient traversal 
and manipulation of weighted graphs. It leverages modern .NET features such as `IMemory<T>` and `Span<T>` to minimize 
memory allocations and maximize performance. 
The focus is on optimizing graph data structures and algorithms for use in scenarios like pathfinding, cost computation, 
and dependency resolution.
